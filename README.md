# BIND9 Build Scripts

### BIND9 Install

Tested and works on:  
* Rocky Linux 8.9

Scripting to standup a primary DNS server or a quick way to rebuild that server.  Also a way to standup or rebuild a secondary server without a need to edit the script each time.

At the top of each will be some variables that need defined, that pertain to your setup.  I am leaving information filled in for both scripts, in hopes that it gives some insight into what belongs there.
